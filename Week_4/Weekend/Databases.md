## Databases

A database is made up of many tables. The tables have columns taht tell us what the contained information is, and the data lives in the tables' rows.

* a database has many tables
* which has many columns
* with many rows
* that contain our data

Relational DBs are when you split information into different groups then refer to that information in different tables.

The primary key (PK) is very important. It is the primary (first, most important, central), key for any row of a table. 

It can be anything, as long as every row in the table has a unique value for its primary key. But most people use numbers of some sort, often in a column labelled something_id.

Outside of their home table, they’re no longer called primary keys. Instead, since they’re on foreign ground, they’re called foreign keys (FK).

Foreign Keys (FKs) are the values that we use to trace our routes between tables.
