## EDA (Event-Driven Architecture)

A summary of EDA is:
When X happens, then do Y.
Where X is the event and Y is the event handler. 

On the client-side, we have the DOM (Document Object Model), which has events like onClick, onFocus, onLoad, as well as custom events. 

## DOM

The DOM is an interface that allows a programming language to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a website.

The document object is a built-in object that has many properties and methods that we can use to access and modify websites.

The DOM can be modified by client-side JavaScript but that will not change the HTML source code.
