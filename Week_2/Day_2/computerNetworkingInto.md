## Computer Networking

### Summary
A computer network is two or more computers that are connected and can communicate with each other. </br>
An example of a computer network could be connecting your phone to your laptop with a USB cable or bluetooth, or they could be connected wirelessly by being connected to the same WiFi router. </br>
Networking isn't just through the internet. The internet is a network, but not every network needs the internet.
</br>

### TCP
TCP is the Transmission Control Protocol and it provides a standard that allows machines to speak to each other.</br>
TCP based communications allow two computers to establish an open channel for two-way data communication.</br> 
A connection is made by one side of the connection "dialing" a specific number, which for a computer is called an IP Address. </br>
A computer can have multiple network-based programs running, so someone created "ports" which act as specific phone number extensions.
